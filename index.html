<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This website is dedicated to presenting <b>advanced mathematical facts and extremely challenging problems</b>
for curious minds, mathematics enthusiasts, and students who enjoy deep thinking.
</p>
<p>
The problems shown here are intentionally provided <b>without solutions</b>. The goal is not memorization,
but logical reasoning, creativity, and intellectual exploration. Many of these problems are inspired by
concepts from number theory, algebra, calculus, geometry, and mathematical logic.
</p>
<p>
If you are preparing for high-level competitions, academic research, or simply love mathematical challenges,
this platform is designed for you.

<h2>Important Mathematical Facts</h2>

<p><b>• Prime Number Distribution:</b><br>
There is no known simple formula that generates all prime numbers. The function π(x), which counts primes
less than x, is approximately x / ln(x), but the exact distribution remains unpredictable.
</p>

<p><b>• Irrational Numbers:</b><br>
Numbers like √2, π, and e cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Their decimal expansions
are infinite and non-repeating.
</p>

<p><b>• Non-Elementary Integrals:</b><br>
Not all integrals have closed-form solutions. For example, ∫ e<sup>−x²</sup> dx cannot be expressed
using elementary functions.
</p>

<p><b>• Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem:</b><br>
In any sufficiently powerful formal system, there exist true mathematical statements that cannot be proven
within the system itself.
